# Arche

A front end starter kit for Sass and JavaScript

### Installation

```
cp -R source/ path/to/your/project
```

### Sass

Follows a (heavily) modified version of the 7-1 pattern found in the [Sass Guidelines](http://sass-guidelin.es/). Since several of those folders will hardly ever be used in my projects, I find it more efficient to add them when necessary rather than include them and not use them.

Directory structure is as follows:

```
|- blocks/
|- globals/
  |- _functions.scss
  |- _mixins.scss
  |- _tags.scss
  |- _typography.scss
  |- _variables.scss
|- pages/
|- sections/
  |- _container.scss
  |- _footer.scss
  |- _header.scss
```

### JavaScript

Nothing fancy here.

```
|- helpers.js
|- main.js
```
